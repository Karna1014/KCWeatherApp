**Usage:**

Weather dashboards such as this are important to our daily lives.  They provide valuable information that allows us to plan appropriately for inclement weather.  Weather affects how and when we travel, what clothes we where, what activities we do in our free time.  Companies that deal with logistics rely on this information to appropriately plan business travel and adjust for impending delays.  Often, being ill-prepared can be very costly as shipments can be delayed, deliveries rerouted, etc. Being aware can give you an edge and in many cases save the day!
